This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has unexpected or invalid configurations in its `package.json`, `app.json`, or other related files.  The error message itself is often vague, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.  For example, it might mention a problem with dependencies, a missing plugin, or an incorrect configuration value.  One common scenario is when there's a mismatch between the versions of dependencies specified in `package.json` and those actually installed. Another common reason is that there are multiple versions of expo installed globally and locally.  Or a dependency is not compatible with the current Expo SDK version.

# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors: Debugging Configuration Issues

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive set of errors encountered when using the Expo CLI.  These errors often stem from misconfigurations within the project's files (e.g., `package.json`, `app.json`, `babel.config.js`) rather than obvious coding mistakes. The lack of specific error messages makes debugging challenging.

The `expoBug.js` file presents a simplified reproduction of a project exhibiting an uncommon Expo CLI error. The `expoBugSolution.js` demonstrates how to resolve the problem by carefully reviewing and correcting project configurations.

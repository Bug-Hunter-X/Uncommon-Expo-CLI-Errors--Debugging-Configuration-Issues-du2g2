To resolve uncommon Expo CLI errors, systematically check the following:

1. **Verify `package.json`:** Ensure all dependencies are compatible with each other and the current Expo SDK version. Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to inspect the dependency tree and identify potential conflicts.  Resolve version mismatches by updating or downgrading packages.
2. **Inspect `app.json`:** Make sure your app's configuration is valid. Check for typos, incorrect keys, or missing values. Pay close attention to plugin configurations and other settings that might impact the build process.
3. **Examine Native Modules:** If you are using native modules, ensure they are correctly installed and configured. Check for errors related to the linking process or build configurations. Clean and rebuild the project.
4. **Clear Caches:** Sometimes, cached files can cause problems.  Try clearing the cache using `expo start --clear` or deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling packages.
5. **Check for Global and Local Expo Versions:** Multiple versions of Expo, either globally or locally, can lead to unpredictable behaviour and errors. Remove and install one globally using `npm i -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`. Use `npm ls expo` or `yarn why expo` to check for the multiple versions.
6. **Check Expo SDK version:** Ensure that your Expo SDK version matches the requirements of the libraries you are using.
7. **Examine Babel Config:** Check your `babel.config.js` for any errors or conflicts. If using plugins, make sure they are properly set up and compatible with your project. 

By systematically checking these points, you can often identify the root cause of these elusive Expo CLI errors.
